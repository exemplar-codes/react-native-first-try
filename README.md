# react-native-first-try

Was setting up React Native, ended up experimenting

Steps to run

1. Install `react-native-cli` globally, by running `npm install -g react-native-cli`.
2. Clone the repo. Do `npm install` inside it.
3. Connect phone (real) to the computer. Accept permissions.
4. Make sure the phone connected by running `adb devices` in the terminal. A device should be added, in the success case.
5. Run `react-native start`, press "a" for Android.
6. "r" when the procees seems to have stopped. Keep pressing this if something gets stuck.
7. The app should now be installed and running on the phone.
8. Editing files should update the app now, automatically
